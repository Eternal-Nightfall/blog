# My Experience with Audience-Driven Interactive Fiction
## But first, an introduction!
This serves as my first blog post, so in the case that you don't know who I am, hiya! I'm Nixi, Nightfall's main headmate, and most of the time you'll see me around.  
I would like to pre-warn you though that I quite often just waffle, so sometimes it might seem I'm over-explaining for the sake of it. During my reviews, I do try to cut down on this, but some of it might get into the final cut. Apologies for that!

## Backstory
I love fiction. I love writing stories and books. Some of you might even know that I started trying to write a few, like Enjoy the Ride, and more recently, the Idyllic Ring.

Don't know any of those? That's completely okay, as I ended up scrapping them. I usually can't stay stuck on an idea for a while, and the concept of having to plan a book and write out all the character's stories ends up just boring me. My ADHD doesn't help at all either: I end up getting distracted by other things and then I can't focus on book-writing.

A little bit more of backstory: we're on the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack), and even have our own channel (`#where-night-falls`, you should join if you're a Hack Clubber!). The concept of Enjoy the Ride came from me trying something out new: trying to involve my channel members into a story.

If you've ever played a "pick a path" game similar to something like **Minecraft: Story Mode** or **Dispatch**, you'll understand the concept of what I call "Interactive Fiction". Essentially, what I'd do is that I'd run a poll in the channel with two options, letting members pick the path they want to go through with. Sometimes, the polls would be open-ended for something like a keypad entry (with clues hidden in previous messages), or to ask questions to the antagonist.

This initial story was even meant to delve into more of an ARG: I had designed a whole "open file server" (it was just a bunch of JavaScript objects nested within each other) with a [KAPLAY](https://kaplayjs.com/) "game" at the end giving more hints as to the character behind the experience. While this did go through well with the initial subject I had designed it for, that was because I knew them personally and most of it was targeted towards them. I would have to redesign the whole thing to get rid of anything personal and it was too much of a hassle in my opinion. I ended up giving more hints towards this character in an unreleased Chapter B of Enjoy the Ride.

After abandoning Enjoy the Ride, I came up with the idea of the Idyllic Ring. While I don't want to leak too much information as I do wish to revive the idea in the form of a visual novel, the whole premise was that it followed a structure similar to Doki Doki Literature Club (minus the part where Monika is self-aware) - going from a cutesy love story into a horror-filled experience for the protagonists. While I did abandon the writing of the Idyllic Ring, I kept it in my mind as I did wish to use the idea again.

## Recently..
A few months ago, I came up with the idea of AFSTYSS (a fate so tragic yet so sweet). It's a collection of two separate (but linking) stories called Fate and Tragedy. Tragedy has been in the works since the original idea was created, but Fate was recently coined.

Tragedy is more similar to how the Idyllic Ring was meant to go: an innocent experience ruined by an outsiding factor. It links into the ARG-ness of Enjoy the Ride as well, giving more information about the protagonist to help eventually solve and finish the game. I don't want to give too much detail because as of the publishing of this blog post, Tragedy is not yet completely developed and I still wish to have the freedom to retcon things that don't make sense yet.  
<small>Also because I still want people to try solve it, and giving too much information ruins the fun.</small>

Fate is the prequel to Tragedy, and follows the audience entering a casino (Fate's Casino / the Casino of Fate), initially because gambling is fun, but eventually realizing that while casinos are rigged, this one seems to be hiding too many secrets.  
**(Legal notice: I do not endorse gambling, especially minors gambling since minors are Hack Club's target audience. [Be GambleAware&reg;](https://gambleaware.org/).)**

Fate is an excellent example of audience-driven interactive fiction: it takes place yet again in our personal channel. However, instead of polls, most of Fate takes shape in the form of puzzles. For example, the initial puzzle (that's still in progress currently) requires users to use an obscure Slack feature to solve the initial part of the puzzle, and there are also two paths to this puzzle which can't be found again if you chose one of them. **Your choices affect their fate.**

Interactive fiction is fun enough, but working together with your friends is way more fun.
